  Given the length of sequences and the number of latents, each sequence within

  This method should be used for slicing sequences that are partitioned, such
  as the inputs to self-attention.
  xmap is used to work around XLA partitioning issues with gathers.
  If regular vmap is used, a bunch of extra allgathers are added.

  Requires the following flags:
  --experimental_xmap_spmd_lowering=True
  --experimental_xmap_spmd_lowering_manual=True

  Args:
    x: Array to slice, expected to be of shape [batch, length, embedding].
